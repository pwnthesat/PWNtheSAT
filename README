This code is intended to search certain sections of HTML for words found in a
Google Docs Spreadsheet, and replaces those strings with links to the 
definitions of those words. It's set up to work on blog.pwnthesat.com, 
but it's currently disabled because it doesn't play nicely with DISQUS, 
AddThis, Facebook, etc. Mostly because I have no idea what I'm doing.
